a motion to prohibit the defense from referring to the three victims’ criminal histories or calling them ‘pejorative’ terms such as ‘looters’ and ‘rioters,’ according to&nbsp;<a class=class

traveled from Antioch, Illinois, on the night of the fatal shootings to help ‘protect’ the streets of Kenosha from violent protest triggered by Blake’s shooting.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Explaining their application to have the weapons charge dismissed, Chirafisi, one of Rittenhouse’s attorneys, argued that the statute only prohibits minors from possessing short-barreled rifles.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Rittenhouse used an AR-style semiautomatic rifle with a 16-inch barrel the night of the shootings, according to Chirafisi.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The only other prohibitions on minors possessing firearms lie in the state’s hunting statutes, which state that children under 12 can’t hunt with guns.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>That doesn’t apply to Rittenhouse because he was 17 on the night of the shootings, Chirafisi said.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Binger countered that the Legislature
