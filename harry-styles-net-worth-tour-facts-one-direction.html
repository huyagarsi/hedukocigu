He and four other contestants were put together to form the band One Direction, which would change their lives forever. Even though they didn't win the competition as solo acts, they became one of the biggest boy bands to come up in the last decade.</p><p>The As It Was singer's first big paycheck reportedly came <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">when he signed a Â£10 million recording deal from Simon Cowell's Syco and Sony Records.</a> While in the band, Styles and his mates released five studio albums: 2011's Up All Night, 2012's Take Me Home, 2013's Midnight Memories, and 2014's Four. The band built a supportive community full of dedicated fans through their music.</p><p>By the time the group was disbanded in 2015, with the release of their last album, Made In The AM, the band was estimated to be worth $130 million combined. 1D's albums performed well on the charts, with over 70 million records sold and 242 awards won; it's no surprise Styles was a millionaire when he went solo.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=one-direction-endorsement-deals-and-tours-made-harry-styles-a-millionaire><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>One Direction Endorsement Deals And Tours Made Harry Styles A Millionaire</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Harry-Styles.jpg><p>The boy band made a huge chunk of their earnings through merchandise, concert tickets, and endorsements. Despite the 1D members having to split their paychecks five times between each other, Styles went home with a hefty sum after the group went on hiatus. The group's last tour, 2015's On The Road Again, made them $208 million in revenue, while their most successful tour, 2014's Where We Are, made $290 million.</p><p>Bringing in that kind of revenue made the group one of the most sought-after bands in the world.
