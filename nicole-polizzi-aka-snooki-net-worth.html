With a fortune like that, saying that she can afford a luxurious lifestyle is not wrong. She loves a comfortable life with her husband, <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><strong>Jionni LaValle</strong></a>, and three kids, <strong><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Lorenzo Dominic LaValle,</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Giovanna Marie LaValle</a>,</strong> and <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><strong>Angelo James LaValle</strong></a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Nicole-Polizzi-with-her-kids-and-husband.jpg><p>Nicole Polizzi‚Äôs husband, Jionni, is an entrepreneur and television figure. His fortune is estimated to be $200 thousand.</p><p>In August 2020, Nicole and her husband purchased a new house in the Silverton section of Toms River for $850,000. Before that, in January 2015, she bought a home in Florham Park for $2.6 million. She and her spouse were also involved in the construction of their dream house from start to finish.</p><p>Moreover, in August 2021, Nicole <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">sold her</a> New Jersey beach house for $740,000. She had purchased the home in November 2015 for $370,000. Seeing that the property was sold for double the price that it was bought for, Snooki definitely benefitted from the sales.</p><p>Apart from real estate investments, the popular television personality has owned cars like the 2011 Cadillac Escalade, which she sold for $77,510 on eBay in February 2013. She might also have other different vehicles for which she must have arranged a good insurance policy.</p><p>Thus, Snooki lives a great life with her family. She often goes to different countries for vacations. Nevertheless, we hope that Nicole Polizzi‚Äôs wealth will increase in the coming days.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Trivia_And_Facts></span>Trivia And Facts<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>Her friends in middle school gave her the nickname ‚ÄúSnooki,‚Äù which is based on the character ‚ÄúSnookie the cootchie crook.‚Äù</li><li>An Italian-American couple adopted and raised her.</li><li>Nicole and Jionni dated for two years before getting married on November 29, 2014.</li></ul><p>For more updates on&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><i><strong>Entertainment</strong></i></a>,&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><i><strong>Celebrity Babies</strong></i></a>,&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><i><strong>YouTubers</strong></i></a>, and&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Movies & T.V.
