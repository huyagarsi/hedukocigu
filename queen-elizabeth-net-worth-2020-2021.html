If you do not know, We have prepared this article about details of Queen Elizabeth’s short biography-wiki, career, professional life, personal life, today’s net worth, age, height, weight, and more facts. Well, if you’re ready, let’s start.</p><h2>Early Life</h2><p>Queen Elizabeth II was born on 21 April 1926 in London in the royal family of the U.K. She was born to Queen Elizabeth I, the Queen Mother and King George VI. She had her education through a private tutor at home. She has a sister Princess Margaret, who was born in 1930. Her father King George VI ascended to the throne in 1936, and since then, she became the heir apparent.</p><h2>Personal Life</h2><p>She was married to Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, in 1947. The royal couple had four children: Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales; Princess Anne; Prince Andrew, the Duke of York; and Prince Edward, the Earl of Essex. Prince Charles, being the eldest son, is the heir to the British throne.</p><p>She became the Queen in 1952, and her coronation was the first to be televised. She is the constitutional monarch, recognized by the British constitution and parliament. She also holds several constitutional titles and positions.</p><h2>Age, Height, and Weight</h2><p>Being born on 21 April 1926, Queen Elizabeth is 98 years old as of today’s date 22nd July 2024. Her height is 1.63 m tall, and her weight is 58 kg.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>Even before she became the queen, Queen Elizabeth undertook public duties during the Second World War. In 1942, she was appointed as an honorary colonel of the Grenadier Guards. Parliamentary laws were amended to make her a Counsellors of State in the absence of her father, King George VI.</p><p>In February 1945, she served in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. She undertook training for driver and mechanic and got the rank of junior commander.</p><p>After her accession as the Queen on 6 Feb. 1952, she took up the role of head of several independent states, which were a part of the British Empire and later came to be called as Commonwealth of Nations.</p><p>Beginning with her 1957 visit to the US and her addressed to the United Nations General Assembly, she has played an important and crucial role in world politics.

Due to her longest reign as Queen, she has become the most widely traveled head of state in the world.</p><h2>Awards & Achievements</h2><p>As the Queen herself is the one who gives the most coveted awards like the Knighthood, it is strange and unthinkable to expect that Queen Elizabeth II would herself be a recipient of the award.</p><p>However, here is an unusual trivia of an award given to her. For the London Olympics opening ceremony in 2012, the Queen she played herself in a short film with the star Daniel Craig playing the character of super-spy James Bond. For this, she was given an honorary BAFTA award to celebrate her patronage to the film industry. In a lighter vein, she was also called the most memorable Bond girl at the BAFTA award ceremony.</p><h2>Net Worth & Salary of Queen Elizabeth in 2024</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wealthypersons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Queen-Elizabeth-Net-Worth.jpg><p>As of July 2024, The net worth of Queen Elizabeth II is estimated to be over $600 million. Her personal properties include the Sandringham House in Norfolk, which is worth $70 million and Balmoral Castle in Scotland, which is pegged at $150 million. The latter is the summer home of the Queen and her family.</p><p>The queen also gets a 15% share in the incomes of the Crown Trust, which has been vested with the crown properties. She gets around $60 million per year from this trust, which generates an annual income in excess of $400 million.</p><p>The trust includes the Crown Estate, the Crown Jewels, and also Buckingham Palace, which itself is worth more than $8 billion. Also included is the $10 billion worth of royal art collection.</p><p>It also owns part of central London, including properties in Regent Street and buildings in St. James. Among its other properties are 263,000 acres of farmland and orchards, vast stretches of seaside and seashore properties in the U.K., and many more, the value of which exceeds $20 billion. The royal family also owns all the unmarked swans in England.</p><p>The Crown Estate was formed at the time of King George III, who was heavily indebted. The trust holds and manages the properties, and an annual income is given to the royal family.</p><p>The Duchy of Lancaster, with about 50,000 acres of property, fetches the Queen an annual income of about $20 million per year.</p><p>The British government also grants an annual privy purse worth about $13 million for personal expenses to the Queen.</p><p>However, a point to note is that these are not personal properties of the queen, which means that she and her successors can only inherit these and enjoy the income arising out of these but cannot sell them off. The Queen is not featured in any Billionaires List, but she remains one of the richest and most influential women in the world.</p><p>At 98 years of age, Queen Elizabeth II is not only the richest woman in the world; she is lo the longest-serving monarch in the world. Besides the inheritances she owns as of the Queen, she also has a considerable personal property which she has inherited from her father King George VI, as well as the Queen Mother Elizabeth. Queen Elizabeth II owns priceless collections of postage stamps, jewelry, and furniture. The world wishes the Queen and her husband Prince Philip a long life and a Platinum Jubilee of the Queen’s accession in 2022.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uLHApauhsaCav7S7zaxlnKedZL62scSnZJ6kma%2Buo7HToWSnnaRixLC%2B06Fka2hiZXpzfJFqZg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./taylor-swift-at-the-2024-golden-globes-lip-reading-theories-more.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Taylor Swift at the 2024 Golden Globes: Lip-Reading Theories, More">&larr;
