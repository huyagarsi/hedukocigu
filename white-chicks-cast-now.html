The Wayans brothers, who also wrote the script for this show, Marlon and Shawn, were featured in Keenen Ivory Wayans’s direction. In White Chicks, two FBI agents, Marcus and Kevin, are tasked with escorting two young heiresses of a billionaire to a weekend-long fashion event in The Hamptons in order to safeguard them from potential kidnappings after failing in prior missions. Unfortunately, they have a car <a href=#>accident</a> en there, and when the girls see the small wounds on their faces, they decide to skip the event. The agents decide to pose as them for the duration of the weekend out of a desire to avoid failing a mission again and a concern for losing their employment. However, it will be far more difficult than they anticipate to get into these girls’ social circles.</p><p>Although White Chicks received negative reviews from critics and even received five nominations for the Golden Raspberry Awards, it nevertheless managed to earn $113 million worldwide and develop a devoted following that helped the movie become a cult favourite. A sequel to the movie was planned for release five years after its first release, but it was ultimately scrapped. As actor Terry Crews made a suggestion that a potential sequel was being discussed in recent years, rumours about this new project started to surface once more. The rumours haven’t been formally confirmed, though, as of yet. Let’s look at the cast members of White Chicks’ most recent endeavours as we wait for any updates on this conceivable sequel.</p><p class=toc_title>Table Of Content</p><ul class=toc_list><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">1</span> Brittany Daniel</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">2</span> Busy Philipps</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">3</span> Frankie Faison</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">4</span> Jaime King</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">5</span> Jennifer Carpenter</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">6</span> Jessica Cauffiel</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">7</span> Lochlyn Munro</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">8</span> Marlon Wayans</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">9</span> Shawn Wayans</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">10</span> Terry Crews</a></li></ul><h3><span id=Brittany_Daniel>Brittany Daniel<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Brittany-Daniel.jpg alt="cast of white chicks twins,white chicks cast member dies,white chicks 2,white chicks twins names,white chicks brittany wilson,white chicks marcus,watch white chicks,jaime king white chicks,cast of white chicks,cast of white chicks then and now,cast of white chicks the movie,producer of white chicks,is white chicks still on netflix,is white chicks on netflix" width=1200 height=630 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>The third member of the Wilson sisters’ adversarial trio, Megan Vandergeld, is Brittany Daniel.
