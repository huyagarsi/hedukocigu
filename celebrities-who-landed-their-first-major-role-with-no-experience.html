Reports of nepotism and networking seem to be the only way to make a break, however, that hasn’t always been accurate. While social media is a great step toward gaining exposure, some of Hollywood’s biggest celebrities didn’t even have access to that. Instead, they landed their first hit roles with no experience, training, or expectations. These 9 celebrities hit a stroke of luck to being discovered, making their careers worth millions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cameron-diaz-joined-up-with-jim-carey><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Cameron Diaz Joined Up With Jim Carey</span></h2><p>Cameron Diaz is no stranger to the luck of Hollywood and, though the actress has been taking it easy since 2014, her career of two decades shot straight to the top. At age 16, Diaz signed on as a model for Calvin Klein, but despite being featured in ad campaigns, she never really took a turn at acting. It wasn’t until <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">age 21 that she auditioned for a small role</a> in The Mask. With no acting experience to her name, she was upgraded to lead actress and the movie cracked the top ten list for 1994, making her an instant star.</p><h2 id=noah-schnapp-studied-with-spielberg><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Noah Schnapp Studied With Spielberg</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Stranger Things became a breakout show for a number of actors of all ages. While some had worked previously on Broadway or in small roles in other films, it was Noah Schnapp who saw success from the start. Schnapp’s<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> first role appeared in Bridge of Spies</a>, directed by Stephen Spielberg and starring Tom Hanks. The young actor then moved to voice Charlie Brown in the 2015 Peanuts Movie before landing to make an impact in Hawkins, Indiana. He’s been killing the game from day one and shows no signs of stopping.</p><h2 id=johnny-depp-stole-a-role-from-a-friend><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Johnny Depp Stole A Role From A Friend</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Widely known for his expansive acting skills, Johnny Depp is a household name. Having conquered everything from Benny and Joon to Pirates of the Caribbean, the actor seemingly steals the show in every role. However, when he started out, he had no intention of acting. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Depp joined a friend at an open audition</a> for Nightmare of Elm Street and, while the friend wasn’t cast, Depp got the role of Glen and stole the show for his iconic scenes.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Real Reason Johnny Depp Doesn't Watch His Own Movies</a></span></p><h2 id=rupert-grint-took-his-shot><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Rupert Grint Took His Shot</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Harry Potter films introduced the public to a diverse crowd of young actors who’d never been on screen before. Though well-known names now, these child actors came from a wide range of training and previous experience. While Emma Watson came from acting school and Daniel Radcliffe came suggested by an agent, it was Rupert Grint who sent in a tape for an open audition with no credits to his name. The young star had a few school plays under his belt, but that didn’t stop him from going professional and joining the top film of 2001 and a series that would film for another decade. Now having completed his character arc, the actor has moved on to family life and <a href=#>new, exciting roles</a>.</p><h2 id=charlize-theron-saw-quick-success><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Charlize Theron Saw Quick Success</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Charlize Theron <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">knows the struggle of trying to pay the bills</a>. The Atomic Blonde actress was discovered in a bank while arguing with a teller about cashing a check. Mid-argument an agent spotted her and decided that she was a star in the making. Within months she had her first role in Children of the Corn III: Urban Harvest despite having no experience under her belt. It only took one year after that for her to appear alongside Tom Hanks in That Thing You Do, solidifying her career.</p><h2 id=danny-trejo-just-wanted-to-help><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Danny Trejo Just Wanted To Help</span></h2><p>Danny Trejo didn’t always have the easiest life. While he’s now known for his action-heavy work in film, he actually started his career thanks to his time in prison. While serving, the actor learned a number of skills, leading to his becoming a youth drug counselor upon release. Trejo was asked to step in on the set of Runaway Train to help manage a drug problem and was noticed by Edward Bunker who recognized him from his own time in prison. Bunker offered Trejo a job training boxing on set and it wasn’t long until Trejo was picked up for a role in Desperado without any acting experience. His look and natural skills took over and <a href=#>he’s been well loved in the action genre since</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Things You Didn't Know About Danny Trejo</a></span></p><h2 id=marilyn-monroe-was-picture-perfect><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Marilyn Monroe Was Picture-Perfect</span></h2><p>One of the biggest names in Hollywood history, Marilyn Monroe wasn’t always a sure shot for success. The actress happened to be<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> spotted by a photographer while working</a> and made her way into modeling following the printing of her shot. From there she dyed her hair, took some acting classes, and was cast in Dangerous Years which kick-started the rest of her acting career. Since then, she’s become an icon, <a href=#>even having biopics made</a> to showcase her life and career.</p><h2 id=jason-statham-got-an-in-with-guy-ritchie><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Jason Statham Got An In With Guy Ritchie</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While he’s known for kicking butt in action films now, Jason Statham <a href=#>wasn’t always slotted for a successful acting career</a>. The actor originally survived in the world of competitive amateur diving and through selling fake jewelry on the streets. It wasn’t until a talent agent noticed him on the street that he was introduced to Guy Ritchie. Ritchie was asking for a street vendor who sold jewelry in the role and, while Statham didn’t have acting experience, he knew well enough about imitating his own life. He landed the part in Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels and became one of the big tough guys of Hollywood.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Is Jason Statham Actually Tough In Real Life?</a></span></p><h2 id=alexis-bledel-got-lucky-with-gilmore-girls><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Alexis Bledel Got Lucky With Gilmore Girls</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rory Gilmore was a household name through the early 2000s and it was no wonder with the overnight success of Gilmore Girls. While the show made names for a number of actors including Lauren Graham and Melissa McCarthy, it was actually Alexis Bledel who lucked out with her lack of experience. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">18-year-old actress</a> had a few model shots to her name and one uncredited role. Though she was slotted for acceptance to NYU’s Tisch School of Arts, she landed Gilmore Girls before she had time to train and successfully became a name in the industry, going on to act in Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants and <a href=#>The Handmaid’s Tale</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwMieqmavmKR6ra3NnZydZaSdsqq%2BjJ%2Bgq6ukYrqits6rZKunnJp6uLXToWSnp12axbGx0aKcp5uVZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-often-does-jeremy-renner-see-daughter-ava-after-sonni-pacheco-divorce.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Often Does Jeremy Renner Actually See His Daughter Ava After His Split From Sonni Pacheco?">&larr;
