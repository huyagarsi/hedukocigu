This show gave us another insight into New Jersey, following the successes of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Real Housewives Of&nbsp; New Jersey </a>and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jersey Shore</a>. Who can forget the drama and entertainment from the world of hair and beauty in the garden state? The show ran from 2010-2013 and followed stylists from hair salons, including The Gatsby Salon, run by Gayle and Christy and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Anthony Robert salon</a>, run by Anthony Lombardi, plus The Glam Fairy in Green Brook Township, New Jersey.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Actors You Didn't Know Were From New Jersey</a></span></p><p>The show showed everything from industry rivalry to their friendships, relationships, breakups, and catfights, especially between Tracy and Olivia. Almost as interesting as what would happen next in the show is who would be wearing what. From revealing, outrageous outfits to heavy make-up, spray tans, over-the-top accessories, and huge earrings, the show and its cast mates had a style all of their own. Since the show last aired, what has the cast been doing? Are they still working in the industry, have they settled down, are they on any other shows? Let’s find out.</p><h2 id=tracy-dimarco-epstein><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Tracy Dimarco-Epstein</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tracy worked at all 3 salons featured on the show and is an owner of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Princess Armor</a> which sells an array of products including shoes, clothing, jewelry, and accessories. She also runs a podcast called Bad Examples with her friend and former Glam Fairy makeup artist, Jessica Romano-Calacione. Tracy was married to Corey Epstein from 2013-2019 and they have 3 children together; Skylar James, Jayden Gene, and Julian Chase. Julian is deaf and has cochlear implants.</p><h2 id=olivia-blois-sharpe><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Olivia Blois Sharpe</span></h2><p>Olivia looks very different from her Jerseylicious days. Gone is the heavy makeup and dark fake tan. She goes for a much more understated look these days, as does Tracy. Olivia is now based in New York City and works for herself, having previously worked as the lead makeup artist for both The Gatsby Salon and Anthony Roberts. She also started her own clothing line <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Two Virgos.</a> Olivia is still popular, having 285k followers on Instagram.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=gigi-liscio><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Gigi Liscio</span></h2><p>Jelena ‘Gigi’ Liscio kept us all hooked with her on-off relationship with Frankie on the show. Gigi is still based in her hometown of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New Jersey</a> and still working as a stylist, she posts a lot of inspiration regarding cuts and colors on her Instagram page. She also has her own website, Gigiliscious, where she sells hair accessories and clip-in extensions.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'Jersey Shore' Fans Are Divided Over Pauly And Vinny's New Show</a></span></p><h2 id=christy-pereira><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Christy Pereira</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Christy still works at The Gatsby Salon and is a happily married mom of two to Daniella and Rocco. Christy was pregnant with her daughter on the show. She describes herself as a ‘cheer mom’ and proudly supports her 11-year-old daughter who is on the school <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cheerleading</a> team. Christy worked at the salon with her mom, Gayle. She posts mainly pics of her kids and family online.</p><h2 id=gayle-giacomo><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Gayle Giacomo</span></h2><p>Gayle still has her beautiful long red tresses, though perhaps a more muted shade than on the show. She also still owns <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Gatsby Salon </a>and posts pics of her work online. Looking at the rare photos posted of her online, it is obvious she has still maintained her youthful figure and she still looks pretty fabulous.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=anthony-lombardi><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Anthony Lombardi</span></h2><p>Anthony is the owner of his own salon and has also written a book called The Glamor State. He writes and posts about entrepreneurship. Anthony says he misses seeing his client’s smiles after he has finished their haircuts, because of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the need to wear masks due to COVID.</a> He is currently recruiting for staff and says good staff are hard to find. Anthony is also a proud father.</p><h2 id=alexa-prisco><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Alexa Prisco</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Alexa is the founder of her own company <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Glam Fairy</a>&nbsp;which specializes in hair and make-up artistry. She had her own spinoff show, The Glam Fairy from 2011-2012. She is a proud mom to a 9-year-old daughter. She is also looking pretty amazing, having lost weight and trying out new looks with her hair and clothing styles.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'Jersey Shore Cast Send Love As JWOWW Opens Up New Retail Store</a></span></p><h2 id=mike-aktari><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Mike Aktari</span></h2><p>Mike was the ex-boyfriend of both Tracy and Olivia which added to their rivalry and tension on the show. Sadly, Mike was found dead at his Long Island home in 2017.&nbsp; He was just 28. Olivia paid tribute to her personal trainer ex on Instagram in a series of emotional posts, c<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">laiming that she would always love him.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=corey-epstein><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Corey Epstein</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In 2015, Corey pleaded guilty to misdemeanor drug possession</a>. He avoided jail under a plea deal and was sentenced to a conditional discharge after pleading guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance, namely oxycodone. His wife at the time, Tracy, insisted that her husband legitimately used this substance following injuries from a stabbing injury two years prior.</p><h2 id=anthony-tango><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Anthony Tango</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Anthony Tango appeared in seasons 4 and 5 of Jerseylicious. Since the show, he has set up his own barbers business, Tango's Barbershop, and also dated an online celebrity, namely beauty influencer and vlogger <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Carli Bybel</a> who is now expecting a baby due this summer.
