In the meantime hit up the comments section and tell us your thoughts on season 10 of The Voice so far.</p><p><strong>Tonight’s episode begins now – Refresh Page often to get the most current updates!</strong></p><p>#VoiceResults starts with introductions of coaches and Adam says he’s proud of Laith and Shalyah and very happy with them both. Pharrell has been down to just Hannah for weeks and he says she’s shown incredible growth and is still so humble.</p><p>Christina says you can’t count your blessings and the odds are always stacked against the females but she wants a female winner and a female coach. Blake is the only coach with three artists and says he was never good at math but three out of eight is good odds.</p><p>Now the eight semi-finalists take the stage and Carson gets right to the first results. Hannah says Pharrell has given her lots of good advice and says he tells her to be herself and be the best version of herself. Shalyah says she misses her siblings and is grateful for the support of her family.</p><p>The first artist saved is from Team Blake – it’s Adam Wakefield.</p><p>Next is a performance by Alicia Keyes – a new judge for The Voice Season 10 then we see some extra footage of when PINK was mentoring the artists.</p><p>The remaining seven artists come back out for another result. Paxton says he’s committed to art and that’s why his performances are always so energetic. This time, Carson announces that America saved, from Team Christina, Alisan Porter.</p><p>Next is a performance by One Republic of their new single Wherever I Go. Now another result – the other six semi-finalists come out. Mary Sarah says she’s honored that Blake says she’s a standard bearer and says she’s honored.</p><p>Bryan says being on the show has taught him how to perform under pressure and on a tight schedule and says now he’s ready for the music industry. The final artist that is safe without having to sing tonight is from Team Pharrell &nbsp;– it’s Hannah Huston.</p><p>The remaining five artists come back out. Three will sing for an Instant Save and two will be eliminated. Laith says it’s important to him to be a musician and a vocalist and says the guitar is an extension of him and says he sang first then picked up guitar.</p><p>Singing for the #InstantSave are Team Blake’s Mary Sarah, Team Christina’s Bryan Bautista, and Team Adam’s Laith Al-Saadi. The two that are eliminated from contention are Paxton Ingram from Team Blake and Shalyah Fearing from Team Adam.</p><p>Mary Sarah sings Something in the Water for her shot at the Instant Save. Pharrell says that showed a lot of intensity and says she showed America that she wants to be here. Coach Blake says he’s literally her biggest fan and he’s amazed she’s having to sing for the save.</p><p>Next is Bryan Bautista who sings Adorn. That has a very Marvin Gaye vibe to it. Nice. Pharrell says he loves his poise and says the high note was great and he represents Brooklyn. Coach Christina says he has grown and does represent and says he’s a true artist and they need to vote him through.</p><p>Laith Al-Saadi is doing All Along the Watchtower. He killed it plus had an awesome guitar solo. Coach Adam says he’s badass and if you want someone who is different, vote for him and says this deserves to be in the finals.</p><p>You can vote with #VoiceSaveMary #VoiceSaveBryan or #VoiceSaveLaith for a five minute window.</p><p>Mary Sarah says if she leaves tonight, the whole experience has been amazing and Blake’s advice has been genuine and real and he inspires her. Bryan says if he leaves, he wants Christina to know she taught him things about himself he didn’t know.</p><p>Laith tells Adam that if he leaves, he wants him to know he appreciates that he understands where he’s coming from and says he understands him and his voice and says he’s been great and made him feel comfortable in his skin and also thanks Pharrell too.</p><p>Blake says he and Mary will still be friends and he’s there for her and will always help her. Christina tells Bryan we do continue to have friendship with our team and that’s what’s great about the show. She says Bryan is a star and has inspired her.</p><p>Adam says to Laith that he wants to thank him for being him and has never had anyone like him on his team and so in touch with what they both love and is happy that they carried the torch and he’s happy they did it our way.</p><p>Now the results – moving into the finals is Team Adam’s Laith Al-Saadi. Team Blake’s Mary Sarah and Team Christina’s Bryan Bautista were eliminated.
