Years after finding fame on the TLC reality series Toddlers and Tiaras and then Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, she <a href=#>opened up about being a child star</a> and admitted that it has been super tough. Alana's fights with her mother June "Mama June" Shannon have been highly publicized as the two continue to appear on various reality shows. Since Alana and Mama June argue so much, fans wonder <a href=#>if Alana has a good bond with her sisters</a>.</p><p>Since Alana became successful at such a young age, people are curious about <a href=#>how Alana spends her net worth</a>. Her financial situation was in the news in the spring of 2024 when fans learned that <strong>Mama June stole money from Alana Thompson</strong>. According to TV Shows Ace, Mama June will give Alana the money she took from her bank account, which is <strong>reportedly $33,000 or $35,000</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In this article, we'll take a look at<strong> Mama June and Alana Thompson's relationship </strong>after this intense situation, along with <strong>why Mama June took her daughter's reality TV earnings</strong>.</p><h2 id=what-is-mama-june-and-alana-thompson-39-s-relationship-like-today>What Is Mama June And Alana Thompson's Relationship Like Today?</h2><p>Thanks to Mama June and Alana Thompson's huge fight about Alana's reality TV earnings that were in a Coogan bank account, <strong>the mother/daughter have a difficult relationship today</strong>.

I've lied to them and told them that you can't get your money until you're 21 so they wouldn't blow through it."</p><p>However, while it seems clear that Mama June spent the money that her daughter earned from her reality TV days, Mama June did say quite a few times on Mama June: Family Crisis that there was still some money in the bank account.</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Honey Boo Boo's Family Members</p></th><th scope=col><p>Net Worths</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>Alana Thompson/Honey Boo Boo</p></td><td><p>$100,000 (via Celebrity Net Worth)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>June Shannon/Mama June</p></td><td><p>$100,000 (via Celebrity Net Worth)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Lauryn "Pumpkin" Efird</p></td><td><p>$200,000 (via Celebrity Net Worth)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Jessica Shannon</p></td><td><p>unknown</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Anna "Chickadee" Cardwell</p></td><td><p>$1 million at time of death (via Showbiz Cheat Sheet)</p></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She also claimed that <strong>Alana can access the money when she's older</strong>.
