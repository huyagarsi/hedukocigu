In the late 1990s and early 2000s, he rose to fame with his appearance in the film Baby Boy and his R&B album “Tyrese”. In 1998, he was first introduced to the world with his self-titled debut album, and in 2001 made his feature film debut in John Singleton’s Baby Boy and gained considerable praise for his role as Jody.</p><p>So how many kids does Tyrese Gibson have? Shayla Somer Gibson, born in 2007, is Tyrese Gibson’s oldest daughter. In 2018, Soraya Lee Gibson, Tyrese’s youngest daughter, was born. Tyrese has always been very vocal about his support and admiration for his daughters, often sharing posts and photos of the two on social media.</p><p>Tyrese had a very public custody battle with his ex-wife Norma Mitchell Gibson when it came to their daughter, Shayla. The dispute gained national attention as Tyrese used social media as a platform to express his version of the story. Fortunately, Tyrese and Norma were able to come to an agreement in which they both have physical and legal custody of Shayla.</p><p>Fast forward to 2018, Tyrese married Samantha Lee and together they welcomed Soraya Lee Gibson into the world. Through Instagram, Tyrese has expressed just how much having his own family has changed his life for the better. He expressed his awe for Samantha’s dedication to her career as a nurse and her commitment to helping others. Sadly, the pair announced their divorce in December 2020 after 3 years of marriage.</p><p>But what about Tyrese Gibson’s net worth in 2023? Being an award-nominated R&B singer-songwriter, rapper, actor, author, model, MTV VJ, and writer, Tyrese has managed to amass a fortune. In addition to his success as an actor in movies and television, Tyrese invested $4 million in a 25,000-square-foot Atlanta estate. The estate features replicas of Transformers, such as Optimus Prime, Bumblebee and more, which Tyrese has often showcased in his social media posts.</p><p>Tyrese Gibson’s daughters, wife and family are prominent figures in the entertainment world. Tyrese has done well to maintain a positive relationship with his ex-wife and fatherhood continues to be a large part of his life. With a current estimated net worth of $25 million, Tyrese is living testament to the power of hard work and dedication.</p><p>Tyrese released a book titled “How To Get Out Of Your Own Way” in 2012. This was the first book that Tyrese publically wrote and was filled with inspirational words and advice to help young adults work through their problems.</p><p>The same year, Tyrese premiered on the show “Take Care of My Child” where he worked with parents who have gone through an extreme struggle with their children. He also guest starred in multiple episodes of the Fox TV Show Empire.</p><p>In 2016 Tyrese wrote another book named “Manology” which focused on intimate relationships between men and women around the world. This book has sold 150,000 copies worldwide and was a great success for Tyrese.</p><p>Late 2019, Tyrese took the world by storm with the release of his third album Black Rose. The album debuted at number one in the US R&B/Hip-Hop Chart and included classics such as “Shame” and “Stay”. This album achieved gold certification and once again put Tyrese back in the spotlight as a major artist.</p><p>That same year, Tyrese had revealed that he was working on a movie called Black Rose alongside Rob Cohen. The movie is set to be released in 2021 and will follow the life of a war veteran named Rose struggling to cope with her PTSD and transitioning back into society.</p><p>In 2020, Tyrese released the 3rd installment in the Black Rose franchise. The film was called “Black Rose: The Resurrection” and was produced independently. The movie was released on digital platforms and followed Rose as she faced her inner demons and worked towards recovery from her PTSD.</p><p>Tyrese Gibson’s career has not slowed down since 2021. Earlier this year, he signed a multi-million dollar deal with JETTY Records. This deal will allow him to release music, books, and films independently while still being able to maintain his professional production team.</p><p>Tyrese is also currently working on his fourth studio album. This project is set to be an ode to classic R&B and a representation of Tyrese’s growth as an artist. The yet untitled project is due out in 2022.</p><p>Perhaps one of Tyrese’s most important projets is his “Pure Love Movement”. This platform teaches the importance of embracing love, communication and understanding when it comes to dealing with relationships and personal growth.</p><p>Tyrese is also currently working on several philanthropic projects. His main focus is to provide youth education, health, and nutrition programs for disadvantaged communities. Tyrese hopes to use his platform to foster change and create a brighter future for the next generation.</p><p>Thanks to Tyrese’s success, he has been able to provide stability for his daughters and wife, who all live comfortably in a lavish estate in Los Angeles. His commitment to his family values is a testament to how far he has come in life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiln5myrbLAnKtnm5%2BifLSxxGafqK9dqcazsdKeZKChkqi8r7%2BMp5ytZaekv7W0jJqlnWWWlrqquNhmo6KelWK1or%2BMnq2opKaasXA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./terrence-howard-saying-mayne-in-hustle-flow-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Watch a Supercut of Terrence Howard Saying Mayne in Hustle &amp;amp; Flow">&larr;
