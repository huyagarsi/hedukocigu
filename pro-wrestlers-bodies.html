Natalya Neidhart reveals her pre-match rituals while Bianca Belair dishes out her favorite protein-packed recipes. Beyond the physical, these women offer valuable insights on overcoming body image issues, dealing with criticism, and staying motivated. As they face the demands of a challenging sport, these wrestlers prove that perseverance and self-belief are the ultimate keys to success.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/07/alexa-bliss-1-1.jpg><p><span>Alexa Bliss opened up about her diet to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Muscle and Fitness</span></a><span>. "It's all about balance. I don't count calories, but I get a feel for what I can eat." She says she does this after previous struggles with eating.&nbsp; "I would look at food and just cry," Bliss says. "I was in and out of the hospital until I came to terms with who I was. Now I know there are more important things than the scale."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/07/GettyImages-1246136378.jpg><p><span>Mandy Rose opened up about her diet and exercise to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Muscle and Fitness</span></a><span>. She says that her recovery from matches is important to her. "Recovery is very important with how much we train," she says. "Rest for me is No. 1, because I need my seven to eight hours of sleep every night. And whenever I can get body work done, like a massage or chiropractor session, I do it."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/07/GettyImages-912767144.jpg><p><span>In an interview with the </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Tampa Bay Times</span></a><span>, Natalya Neidhart opened up about what she eats before a match. "I went to the Sky Lounge in the LaGuardia airport and had a little bit of Greek yogurt and a cappuccino with skim milk. I always like to have a little bit of coffee in the morning â€” it's more of a ritual for me than the taste. I like to sit and have 15 minutes to myself to just drink my coffee and reflect and think about what my day is going to be like. They served a breakfast burrito on the plane. To be brutally honest, I don't really love airplane food, but no matter what, you can make something out of nothing. I had a couple of bites, that that way I could feel like I was getting a little bit without all the calories. Then I just had water on the plane. Whenever I travel I try to hydrate as much as possible. I hate that dehydrated feeling, it makes me super tired. They also served some fresh fruit so I had a little bit of that. That way when I landed I didn't feel too bloated or heavy."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/07/GettyImages-1024797708.jpg><p><span>Carmella, also known as Leah Van Dale, shared her workout routine with </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Women Fitness</span></a><span>. "</span><span>I always warm up on the bike or treadmill for about 20-30 minutes before I lift. Stretching is something I really need to get back into my daily routine. With my schedule, it's so hard to fit everything in. I usually only have time to train OR stretch, but I really need to start making time for both. I notice such a difference in my body when I take the time to stretch properly.</span><span>"</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/07/GettyImages-1421810127.jpg><p><span>Britt Baker shared her approach to exercise in an interview with </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Muscle and Fitness</span></a><span>. "I'm, admittedly, a very late-night workout girl," she said. "I'm at the gym, usually at 10pm, finishing up around 11.30pm or midnight. That's just how it works for me now because that's the only time I can fit in. When I'm home, in a typical day, I wake up, go to the dental office and I'm there sometimes until 7pm, come home, eat really quick, say hello to my boyfriend (who just happens to be fellow AEW superstar; Adam Cole then I go to the gym."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/07/becky-lynch.jpg><p><span>Becky Lynch revealed how she stays motivated in an interview with </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Muscle and Fitness.</span></a> <span>"Championships represent being at the top of your game.

We use a lot of greens!"</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/07/GettyImages-1335691069.jpg><p><span>Natalie Eva Marie shared some of her workout tips with </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Ryderwear.com</span></a><span>. </span><span>"Everyday I am constantly trying to improve mentally, physically, and spiritually. I work a 12 step program of recovery so my sobriety is my number one priority and I know without it I wouldn't be able to do all the things that I am doing in my life.

"I feel revived and alive again with wrestling," she said. "I started this because I love wrestling. Back when I was younger in Australia, I wanted to be a wrestler and loved what I did with WWE. It's completely different now. It's not five minutes on TV where I'm asked to do such and such. It's having competitive singles matches every night. There are different opponents every night. I'm meeting new people and improving my own skills every time by working with different people in the ring. It got me going again."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/07/GettyImages-1460455196.jpg><p><span>Indi Hartwell opened up about her career to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Busted Open Radio</span></a><span>. </span><span>"I thought to myself, 'if I get it all at once, where do I go from there?' I'm still pretty young in this business. I've been wrestling for seven years, but that's nothing compared to some people. I'm all about the slow and steady. I know it's a marathon and not a sprint. A lot of my coaches tell me that. I just try to keep that in mind."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/07/GettyImages-1538175582.jpg><p><span>Bianca Belair makes sure to eat healthy.

"I might need to lose 5 pounds. I might need to lose 6 or 7 pounds. I'm not against the losing weight part. But, I'm against calling people out for it. And I'm against people who call themselves fans thinking it is okay to criticize a woman's body because it is more than doing squats. I do squats every day. It is a mental game as well. It is so much more than just working out.

"How you talk to yourself really matters. I never believed that I could be on TV, or be a performer, or any of those things â€¦ Why did I tell myself that for so many years? And now, here I am, the most decorated women's champion of all-time. Why do we tell ourselves that we can't do something? It's because we are scared of it. So, do what you are scared of.

"Sometimes there's some bad food on the road, maybe some drinks after the shows, and that really caught up with me because I was just constantly on the road for years with no routine, not getting enough sleep. All of those things started to weigh heavy on me but now I don't drink any alcohol. I've noticed an immense difference.
