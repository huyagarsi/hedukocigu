It really is a phenomenal feeling. That is, until you start sweating under the covers, or you realize there’s a hole in your new sheets or that you’re even getting a rash from their subpar quality. Yeah, not so relaxing anymore!</p><p>High-quality bedding is on investment we believe everyone should make at some point or another, and that time for most of us is going to be…well, now! <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Boll & Branch’s Semi-Annual Sale</a> has just kicked off, and you’re not going to find deals like this again until the holiday season. We’re talking 20% off sitewide with code <strong>SEMIANNUAL20</strong> — but only for six days! You only have until Sunday, August 2, 2020 to save big, so let’s get moving!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Save <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">20% sitewide </a>with code SEMIANNUAL20 during the Semi-Annual Sale at Boll & Branch! Sale ends August 2, 2020.</strong></p><p>Buying high-quality products from a brand like Boll & Branch is basically a form of self-care, and ultimately, it’s going to make your wallet happy too. Your $20 sheets need to be replaced all the time, and they’re basically just acting as a plug-in, fulfilling the basic requirements of a necessity. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Boll & Branch sheets</a> though? They’re made to provide you with a lifetime of comfort and happiness. Good things come in such timeless styles — as does everything else on the site!</p><p>If you want to feel good in your bedding and towels while also feeling great about them, you need to shop <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Boll & Branch</a>. The brand’s products are all ethically made and sustainably sourced. What does this mean, exactly? Well, they saved over 592 million gallons of water and over 21,000 tons of carbon emissions in 2018. Plus, B&B provides 1,000 textile workers with fair pay and safe workplaces. On top of that? For each Boll & Branch’s Fair Trade item sold, the workers earn a premium to invest back in their communities for social development projects and fighting poverty. How cool is that?</p><p>Just to reassure you, staying sustainable doesn’t mean cutting corners when it comes to quality. Not at Boll & Branch. The brand’s products are all chemical-free and made with top-quality raw materials. You’ll find 100% organic cotton everywhere!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Save <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">20% sitewide </a>with code SEMIANNUAL20 during the Semi-Annual Sale at Boll & Branch! Sale ends August 2, 2020.</strong></p><p>Need some product recommendations? We’ve got you. Let’s get back to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">those sheets</a> we were raving about. This bestselling bedding is made from 100% organic, toxin-free cotton, and you have so many styles and colors to choose from. The signature fabric is soft and drapey and comes in a bunch of designs, from sleek and simple, to embroidered, to color-blocked and more. If you’re a hot sleeper though, you might be a fan of the percale fabric sheets. They’re crisp and cool, kind of like fresh sheets in a fancy hotel.</p><p>If you’re getting new sheets, why not grab <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a new pillow</a> too? Boll & Branch offers both down and down alternative pillows so everyone can have ultra-sweet, ultra-cozy dreams. They’re each available in three levels of density too: soft, medium and firm. Of course, they also have a 100% organic cotton shell, as to be expected!</p><p>These pillows are designed for optical neck and spine alignment, and each one is finished by hand for a personal, perfected touch. If you’re going <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">down</a>, know that the materials were sourced from a family farm in the U.S. and triple-washed in an environmentally-safe detergent. That’s two times cleaner than the government standard! If you’re going for the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">down alternative</a> instead, you can rest easy knowing you’re getting an allergy-friendly pillow that was only introduced after years of product testing. It’s made with premium synthetic fiber that mimics down’s three-dimensional loft!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Save <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">20% sitewide </a>with code SEMIANNUAL20 during the Semi-Annual Sale at Boll & Branch! Sale ends August 2, 2020.</strong></p><p>Our final recommendation (though we could always go on) is that you grab something from either the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Spa Bath Collection </a>or the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Plush Bath Collection</a>. That’s right — we’re talking towels! Just like your sheets and pillows, you use towels every day, so investing in a high-quality set is going to change everything. All of these towels are free from pesticides, formaldehyde, and harsh, irritating chemicals. The difference between the collections? The towels from the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Plush</a> collection have a velvety feel with dense, high pile, so you’ll be a fan if you’re down with the softness. The towels from the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Spa</a> collection, on the other hand, are super lightweight and textured, made to dry you off quickly. These collections were recently expanded, so being able to score 20% off is just huge, whether we’re grabbing one towel or enough for our whole family!</p><p>As we mentioned, all good things must come to an end, so even though this sale just started, you only have days left to shop with code <strong>SEMIANNUAL20</strong>. Grab your faves, spread the word and enjoy your new, luxurious home!</p><p><strong>Save <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">20% sitewide </a>with code SEMIANNUAL20 during the Semi-Annual Sale at Boll & Branch!
