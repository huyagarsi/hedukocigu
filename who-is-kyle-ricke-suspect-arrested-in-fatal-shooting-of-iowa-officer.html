Many are interested in knowing the suspect, Kyle Ricke. Wednesday night’s deadly shooting of a police officer in northern Iowa sparked a manhunt that resulted in his capture in Minnesota. The accused is accused of murder.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>According to the Iowa Department of Public Safety, the officer, 33-year-old Kevin Cram, was shot near Algona while attempting to detain a guy who had a warrant out for his arrest for harassment. Hospitalized, Cram eventually passed away. A Blue Alert was issued to inform the public that a suspect who might constitute a threat to law enforcement was on the run after the 43-year-old suspect fled.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-is-kyle-ricke><strong>Who is Kyle Ricke?</strong></h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>An Iowa man named Kyle Ricke came to light because of his suspected involvement in a criminal case that included the shooting and death of a police officer in Algona, Iowa.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-is-kyle-ricke-in-jail><strong>Is Kyle Ricke in jail?</strong></h2><p>Currently, Kyle Ricke is being held in the Brown County Jail while he awaits the outcome of the serious murder charges related to Officer Cram’s passing.</p><p>Officer Cram, a veteran of 10 years in law enforcement, was patrolling the neighbourhood that fateful evening shortly before 8 o’clock when the events started to take place.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>His objective was to find Kyle Ricke, a 43-year-old man wanted on harassment charges.</p><p>This warrant came about as a result of disturbing behaviour, which included communicating with an ex-partner via numerous phone calls and texts despite being advised by law enforcement authorities to stop doing so.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Tragically, things got worse when Ricke is accused of shooting Officer Cram and fleeing the scene, leaving the people of Algona in disbelief and grief.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Although rapid efforts were made to resuscitate Officer Cram, he was later declared dead at a nearby hospital.</p><p>Officer Kevin Cram, who is recognised as a hero eager to stand in the breach between good and evil, is still being mourned by the Algona community and law enforcement authorities.</p><p>Law enforcement organisations from Iowa and Minnesota worked closely together during the search for Ricke.</p><p>While cops searched the area for the culprit, residents of Algona were advised to stay indoors and secure their doors and cars.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>In an unexpected turn of events, Ricke was found about midnight in Leavenworth Township, rural Sleepy Eye, Minnesota, about 100 miles north of Algona.</p><p>Fortunately, his capture was carried out without incident by deputies from the Brown County Sheriff’s Office.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kyle-ricke-arrest-and-charges><strong>Kyle Ricke Arrest and Charges</strong></h2><p>Following his suspected involvement in a terrible incident, Kyle Ricke, the shooting suspect in Algona, Iowa, has drawn a lot of attention and worry.</p><p>Officer Kevin Cram was shot and killed during a police interaction, and Ricke was accused of doing it in the little village of Algona.</p><p>Kyle had already caught the attention of police authorities prior to this tragic episode as a result of a different harassing incident.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>According to court documents, Ricke was accused of third-degree harassment on August 28.</p><p>The accusations were the result of a sad incident in which Ricke’s ex-partner claimed to have missed multiple phone calls and a deluge of texts over a two-hour period.</p><p>This flurry of correspondence started after the victim made it obvious she wanted to stop speaking with Ricke.</p><p>At that point, law enforcement got involved and told Ricke not to talk to the woman any more. He was also properly informed that if he disobeyed this order, harassment charges would be brought against him.</p><p>Tragically, the victim went back to the authorities four days later with more proof of Ricke’s persistent harassment, showing that he had ostensibly disregarded the first warning.</p><p>Following this, Kyle was charged, arrested, and a no-contact order was subsequently obtained on August 28.</p><p>Ricke is currently facing legal action, and his trial in Kossuth County court is planned for November 3rd. Ricke allegedly shot and killed Officer Kevin Cram in Algona, leading to the first-degree murder charges he now faces in connection with this tragic incident.</p><p>source: <a href=#>www.ghbase.com</a></p><ul class=td-pulldown-filter-list></ul><a class="td-social-sharing-button td-social-handler td-social-expand-tabs" href=# data-block-uid=tdi_37 title=More><i class="td-icon-plus td-social-expand-tabs-icon"></i></a><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTBmqqeZpOkunDDx6hkoqtdoMatsYyroJyjlWLAtr%2FPnpqtZZGnv6a%2F056bZqGeYrOiwMClZKygn6TBqrrGZqafZZmkxKJ5zp%2BdopuVp3w%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./dog-days-are-over-lyrics-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="                    Florence + The Machine                                          Dog Days A">&larr;
