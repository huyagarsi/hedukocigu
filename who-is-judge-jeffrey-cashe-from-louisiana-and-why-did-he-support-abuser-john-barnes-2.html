Find out more about him.</p><p>Before getting his law degree from St. Mary’s School of Law in San Antonio, Texas, Judge Cashe attended Louisiana State University and Southeastern Louisiana University.</p><p>He started his legal career in San Antonio with the Baucum Steed Barker, LLC company. Upon his return to Louisiana in 2004, Judge Cashe joined the firm of Cashe, Lewis, Coudrain, and Sandage, which his late father, Rodney Cashe, had established.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-judge-jeffrey-cashe-from-louisiana></span>Who Is Judge Jeffrey Cashe From Louisiana?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Judge Jeffrey Cashe rendered the contentious choice. He was appointed a judge for the Division “J” Family Court in January 2015, according to the 21st Judicial District Court.</p><p>Cashe allegedly earned his undergraduate degree from Southeastern Louisiana University before enrolling at St. Mary’s University School of Law to earn his law degree.</p><p>He began practicing law in San Antonio at Baucum Steed Barker, LLC. He later joined the company Cashe, Lewis, Coudrain, and Sandage, established by his late father, Rodney Cashe.</p><p>According to a list of his professional affiliations, he is the President of the 21st JDC Bar Association, a Board Member and Former Pro Bono Advisor to the Richard Murphy Hospice Foundation, a Board Member of the Hammond Downtown Development District and Chamber of Commerce, and a former Board Member of the Home Mortgage Authority.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-jeffrey-cashe-a-democrat-or-republican></span>Is Jeffrey Cashe A Democrat or Republican?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jeffrey Cashe hasn’t stated if he is a democrat or a republican; thus, we don’t know. He serves on the boards of several organizations, including the Richard Murphy Hospice Foundation, the Chamber of Commerce and Downtown Development District of Hammond, and the Home Mortgage Authority. He is also the President of the 21st JDC Bar Association.</p><p>Many people are angry and demoralized by Cashe’s latest decision. According to Stacie Triche of the nonprofit organization Save Lives, she has reportedly been forced to pay her perpetrator. The latter also stated, “When I found out she was a rape victim, and this rapist could potentially get full custody, that’s when I stepped in and said something has to be done about this, forced to give up custody of the kid born as a result of the rape and pay legal costs for her rapist. It is illogical.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-did-jeffrey-cashe-support-rapist-john-barnes></span>Why Did Jeffrey Cashe Support Rapist John Barnes?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>According to a report, a judge in Louisiana granted custody of the child born as a result of the alleged rape in 2005 to the suspected offender and later ordered the victim, who was young, to pay child support.</p><p>When a man nearly twice her age volunteered to drive her home from a nearby restaurant after a night out with friends, Crysta Abelseth, then 16, claimed to WBRZ that she was raped.</p><p>About John Barnes, who was 30 years old at the time, Abelseth remarked, “Instead of bringing me home, he brought me to his residence.” “Once inside, he violated me on the couch in his living room.”</p><p>According to the station, the adolescent became pregnant and gave birth to a daughter who is currently a teenager.</p><p>After learning that the Louisiana statute of limitations applied, Abelseth charged Barnes with rape in 2015, according to the station.</p><p>According to the station, the Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff’s Office was still investigating the issue, and no charges had been brought.</p><p>The now-32-year-old claimed she has found it challenging to work with the legal system and claims to have lost custody of her daughter due to claims that she gave her a smartphone.</p><p>According to the article, court documents related to the case were mysteriously sealed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4yjrJ2flWK3prLFq5yyZZOWwKmxjJ%2BpqKVdoby2tdKimKeZXZa7pXnWobBmnJmZeqmxjKysqaifp8FurcGuqp6qXZ%2B8qbqMm5irppWoenN7</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./anthony-boswell-net-worth-income-salary-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Anthony Boswell Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?">&larr;
