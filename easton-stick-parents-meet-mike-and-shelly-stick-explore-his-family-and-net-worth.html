Mike would pick him up and drop him off for practices and games.</p><p>Easton’s parents were an important part of his support system throughout high school, attending every game and function and cheering him on from the bleachers.&nbsp;Similarly, when the Los Angeles Chargers signed the young athlete, his parents were overjoyed and proud of all he had accomplished. They are thankful for the chance to see his success at the highest level of competition.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=easton-sticks-parents-family-and-ethnic-background></span>Easton Stick’s Parents, Family, and Ethnic Background<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Easton Stick</strong>, of white race and European origin, is the son of Mike and Shelly Stick.&nbsp;There is limited information accessible online regarding Easton’s family, including the ages of his parents and brother Aaron.&nbsp;Easton’s father, Mike, did, however, have a short professional baseball career while attending Creighton University. After that, he spent a year in the Chicago Cubs organization.</p><p>While attending NDSU, the young man won two national championships and received other honors. He was also voted the 2019 FCS Championship Game’s Most Outstanding Player.&nbsp;Easton declared for the NFL draft in 2019 and was taken in the fifth round by the Los Angeles Chargers.&nbsp;He has subsequently established himself as a valued team member, seeing action as a backup quarterback and special teams player.&nbsp;Despite his hectic schedule as a professional player, Easton maintains good relationships with his family and thanks his parents and brother for their ongoing support and wisdom.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=easton-sticks-net-worth></span>Easton Stick’s Net worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>According to Celebs Age Wiki, Easton Stick has a net worth of between $1 million and $5 million as of 2023.&nbsp;His earnings are mostly earned from his successful professional football career.
